        Our team has worked together on voice user interfaces (VUI) for over
        three years. We started off making multi-modal services that worked on
        Alexa, Google, and Cortana. If you need a 
        <a href="https://thebartender.io">drink</a> or 
        <a href="https://tasted.com">recipe</a>, you should try them out.

        While we were making our smart speaker skills, we released our{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/spokestack">
          automatic speech recognition (ASR) manager
        </a>
        . We started to see other developers experimenting with Spokestack and
        voice control in their mobile apps, so in the Fall of 2019 we decided to
        focus on enabling voice on mobile apps. Our mission is to give every
        mobile app a voice and make smart phones even smarter. If successful, we
        will all spend less time looking at our phones and getting other things
        done.

        Prior to Spokestack, our team has worked for world-class consumer
        technology companies. We are active in open-source projects and
        communities and are committed to creating an open, secure VUI platform
        for developers.
