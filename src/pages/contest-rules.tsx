          <p>
            The Contest asks developers to convert their smart speaker skill to
            a mobile app on either iOS and/or Android mobile platforms using
            Spokestack’s Free Developer Package. This developer package contains
            the following tools:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) management</li>
            <li>An on-device natural language understanding (NLU) service</li>
            <li>The Spokestack Free Text-To-Speech Service</li>
            <li>A free Spokestack developer account</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After creating a Spokestack developer account, developers can export
            their smart speaker app’s interaction model and upload it to
            Spokestack for training for Spokestack’s on-device NLU service.
            Directions for exporting interaction models and uploading for
            training are included in Spokestack’s documentation. Spokestack
            includes Swift, Java and React Native programming language examples
            of Spokestack-powered mobile apps based on smart speaker interaction
            models.

            The decisions of the Sponsor are final and binding on all matters
            relating to this Contest. Sponsor shall have the sole right to
            disqualify any entrant for violation of these Official Rules or any
            applicable laws relating to the Contest, and to resolve all disputes
            in Sponsor’s sole discretion. Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term
            of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that
            provision.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a dispute as to the ownership of any entry, the

            corrupts the administration, security, or fairness of the Contest,
            as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. In such event,
            Sponsor reserves the right to award the prize(s) from among the
            non-suspect eligible Submissions received up to the time of the

            discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering
            with the entry process or the operation of the Contest, annoying,
            abusing, threatening or harassing any other entrant or
            Sponsor&rsquo;s representatives, or to be acting in violation of
            these Official Rules. Any attempt by any person to undermine the
            legitimate operation of the Contest may be a violation of criminal
            and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, Sponsor reserves
            the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent
            permitted by law.
