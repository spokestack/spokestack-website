          information about the browser you&rsquo;re using. We might look at
          what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. In
          a mobile environment, we might collect your location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job application information. If you apply for a job, we collect
          information about you, your prior education and work history and your
          skills and qualifications for the position. &nbsp;We may ask about
          your salary expectations, how you learned of the position and your
          driving record or other information about your ability to perform the
          position. We may also collect the last four digits of your social
          security number and your nationality.
        </p>

        <h3>How we collect information</h3>
        <p>
          We collect information directly from you. We collect information if
          you sign up for a newsletter, enter a promotion or fill out an online
          survey. We also collect information if you make a purchase or apply
          for a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect information from you passively. We may use tracking tools
          like browser cookies and web beacons. We also collect information from
          our mobile apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          We get information about you from third parties. For example, our
          business partners or social media platforms may give us information
          about you.
        </p>

        <h3>How we use information</h3>
        <p>
          We use information to respond to your requests, questions,
          applications and entries. We may use your information to respond to
          your comments and questions, to notify you if you win a contest or
          sweepstakes or complete a purchase. If you apply for a job, we may use
          your information to process your application and determine if you are
          qualified.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use information to improve our products and services. We may use
          your information to make our websites and products better. We might
          use your information to customize your experience with us. We may
          combine information we get from you with information about you we get
          from third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use information for security purposes. We may use information to
          protect our company, our customers, and our websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use information for marketing purposes. For example, we might send
          you information about new products and special offers. We might tell
          you about new promotions, features or updates. These might be third
          party offers or products we think you might find interesting. &nbsp;We
          may also use push notifications on our mobile apps. To manage this,
          read the &ldquo;Your Choices&rdquo; section below.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use information to communicate with you about your account or our
          relationship. We may contact you about your account or feedback. We
          might also contact you about this Policy or our website Terms.
        </p>
        <p>We use information as otherwise permitted by law.</p>

        <h3>Sharing information</h3>
        <p>
          We may share information within the Pylon ai family of companies which
          may be launched in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share information with third parties who perform services on
          our behalf. For example, we share information with vendors so they can
          perform services for us. &nbsp;We may also share information with
          companies that operate our websites or run a promotion for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share information with joint promotion partners. Sometimes we
          conduct joint promotions with third parties. &nbsp;If you register for
          one of those joint promotions your information may be collected by
          both Pylon ai and the third party. &nbsp;Or, we may give you the
          option to have us share your information with the promotion partner.
          &nbsp;Your information will be used by us and/or by them as described
          in our posted privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply
          with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share
          information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may share it
          if a government agency or investigatory body requests. We might share
          information when we are investigating potential fraud. &nbsp;This
          might include fraud we think has happened during a sweepstakes or
          promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share information with any successor to all or part of our
          business. For example, if part of our business is sold we may give our
          customer list as part of that transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share information for other reasons we may describe to you.
        </p>

        <h3>Your choices about sharing and marketing practices</h3>
        <p>
          You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails. To stop receiving
          promotional emails from us, follow the instructions in any promotional
          message you get from us. Even if you opt out of getting marketing
          messages, we will still send you transactional messages and respond to
          questions from you.
        </p>

        <h3>California privacy rights</h3>
        <p>
          If you reside in California, you have the right to ask us one time
          each year if we have shared personal information with third parties
          for their direct marketing purposes. To make a request, please send us
          an email or write to us at the address listed below. Indicate in your
          letter that you are a California resident making a &ldquo;shine the
          light&rdquo; inquiry.
        </p>

        <h3>Our sites are not for kids</h3>
        <p>
          Our sites and apps are meant for adults and teens. We do not knowingly
          collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If
          you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child under 13 has
          given us information, you can contact us. Parents can learn more about
          how to protect children&#39;s privacy on-line here:
          https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/protecting-kids-online
        </p>

        <h3>We use standard security measures</h3>
        <p>
          The Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of
          our sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution
          when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords. We
          keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for
          the practices described in this Policy. We also keep information as
          otherwise required by law.
        </p>

        <h3>We store information in the United States</h3>
        <p>
          If you live outside of the U.S., you understand and agree that we may
          transfer your information to the United States. This site is subject
          to U.S. laws, which may not afford the same level of protection as
          those in your country.
        </p>

        <h3>
          We may link to other sites or have third party services on our site we
          don&rsquo;t control
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to
          websites or pages we do not control. &nbsp;This includes social media
          sites. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third
          party websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully.
          We are not responsible for third party policies or practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our site may also serve third party content that contains the third
          party&rsquo;s own cookies or tracking technologies. &nbsp;We do not
          control the use of those technologies.
        </p>

        <h3>We use common tracking technologies</h3>
        <p>
          We collect personal information about users over time and across
          different Web sites when you use this Web site or service. We also
          have third parties that collect personal information this way. We use
          several common tracking tools to do this. Our vendors may also use
          these tools. These tools may include browser cookies or web beacons.
          We use these tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To recognize new or past customers.</li>
          <li>To store your password if you are registered on our site.</li>
          <li>To improve our website.</li>
          <li>
            To serve you with advertising content in which we think you will be
            interested. To do so, we may observe your behaviors on this website
            and other websites. We may also collect information about your
            browsing history.
          </li>
          <li>
            To better understand the interests of our customers and our website
            visitors
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>You can control tracking tools</h3>
        <p>
          Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do
          so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to
          reject browser cookies. If you block cookies on your browser, certain
          features on our sites may not work. Choices you make are both browser
          and device-specific. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the
          tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can control tools on your mobile devices. For example, you can
          turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone. Each
          push notification has an &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; link. Some browsers
          have a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; feature that lets you tell websites
          that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These
          features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to
          respond to those signals.
        </p>

        <h3>Our ads may be served based on tracking</h3>
        <p>
          We may work with online advertising companies to show you relevant and
          useful ads. This includes ads served on other companies&rsquo; sites.
          These ads may be served based on information collected by us or third
          parties. For example, information a third party collects when you
          register for a site, like your zip code. This might be used to target
          an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your
          activities on our websites or on third party sites.
        </p>

        <h3>You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising</h3>
        <p>
          To opt out of having your online behavior collected for advertising
          purposes, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices. Choices you make are
          both browser and device-specific.
