Even if you already have an idea of who your users are, adding voice to your app may change that demographic. Not all users are going to adopt this change. Who will a multi-modal approach help? Understanding your audience will help you identify how to integrate voice. This section is for teams and individuals with an existing app or who are starting from scratch.

# **Behavioral examples**

> **For existing apps, in what context are my users using my app? Are they using it while doing other things?**
> Some examples might include commuting (driving, biking, walking, etc.), exercising, cooking, and childcare.
>
> **If starting from scratch, when/where is your target audience completing similar tasks? Are they completing them while doing other things?**
> The examples in the previous section are also relevant here.
>
> **What devices do they pair with their mobile device?**
> Some examples include Airpods, smart watches, and other voice-activated wearables.
>
> **Are your users iOS or Android?**
> This will influence which platform you should/will focus on.
>
> **How familiar are your users with voice assistants? How often do they use them? If they don't use voice assistants, why not?**
> This will help you understand their motivations. If they don’t already use voice in their day-to-day routine, it’s important to understand why. For some, it may be a technical limitation or afterthought. For others, they may not understand the value.

# **Yes, that might mean a survey**

There are many ways of gathering this information; we use [Google Surveys](https://surveys.google.com/warm-welcome?dest=%2Fyour-surveys%3Fcategory%3Dexample). Provide a mix of [quantitative and qualitative questions](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/qualitative-surveys/) based on what you’re trying to find. Draft your survey and get feedback from your teammates or people you trust.

Take survey results with a grain of salt. Use them as a starting point for further exploration rather than definitive results. You’ll also be able to use this as a recruiting tool when looking for interview and [test candidates](/docs/Design/test-with-real-people). If you want to recruit candidates for [in-person user testing](/docs/Design/test-with-real-people) later on, make sure you ask for location.

# **Talk to the people you’re trying to target**

Conduct [user interviews](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/) remote or in-person. Schedule time with candidates you’ve found from your survey and offer them an incentive if able.

Before the interview, create a document or **one-sheet** for each participant. Include the date and the name of the participant in the document’s title. For shared documentation, we use [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/). Review survey responses with your team. Write down relevant information under demographics. Here’s a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15YtXuLhlOKrNa6m9ElFBuG-O2ppCc4obVlivl4Dhqfk/edit?usp=sharing) to get you started.

You’ll be in charge of the discussion. Come prepared with questions, but feel free to improvise. Questions will come to mind as your conversation progresses. We recommend using a script. Here’s an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KdaeVRv1nlvMvZTMyglkvuv8EG8z6Lcv8Ca9-oLUkjY/edit?usp=sharing) we adapted from Steve Krug’s [Rocket Surgery Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292). Write down questions specific to a candidate on their one-sheet and make note in your script of when to ask them.

Look for the following during your interviews:

1. How are they talking about completing certain tasks? What words are they using?
2. What platforms/tools do they already use to complete these tasks? Are they satisfied or dissatisfied with their current setup?
3. How could their current setup be improved (even if they’re already satisfied)?

Have your one-sheet on hand during the interview for infrequent note taking. If candidates feel comfortable, stream the discussion so your team can ask questions. For live streaming, we use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). For internal communication during interviews, we use [Slack](https://slack.com/).

After the interview, use your recording to document takeaways. Discuss insights with fellow observers. Allow no more than 20 minutes for this.

Every project presents a new set of challenges. Need someone to facilitate this process? We can help.
