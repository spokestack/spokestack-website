Before we begin, some terminology to make sure we're all on the same page moving forward.

## Modes of Input

### Gesture-only

A visual interface with clear boundaries and consistent UI inputs. For existing app owners, this is the modality your app supports today. Users are already familiar with this mode of input and know what to expect.

### Voice-only

A conversation with a device independent of visuals. Many users have experienced voice-only interfaces via smart speakers and other headless devices (Alexa, Google Home, etc.). Voice is an intuitive and convenient way to interact. Users can access information and send commands without touching anything. Speaking is also [three times faster than typing](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a22684/phone-dictation-typing-speed/).

The primary weakness of voice-only interactions is delivering information back to users. This is especially true for complex information and lists. Have you ever asked Alexa or Google Home for a recipe? If so, you'll understand our pain.

There are many reasons voice output can be inferior to text. Humans get distracted. Active listening requires effort. Reading allows users to understand at their own speed, usually at a faster rate. The average human reads [250-300 words per minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute). The average audiobook reads [150-160 words per minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute).

### Multi-modal (voice + gesture)

An interface that provides more than one mode of interaction. In this case, we're referring to **speech-to-text** paired with a visual UI. Many users have experienced multi-modal interfaces via mobile voice assistants (Siri, Google Assistant, etc.).

Some benefits of this pairing include the following:

1. **More control.** A multi-modal approach lets users choose how they interact. Users are able to choose how they input and receive output. This could mean voice-only makes sense in some situations. Gesture-only or some combination of both could make sense in other situations.

2. **Higher success rate**. Multi-modal experiences deliver on a limited domain or set of domains. For example, you're unlikely to find someone asking to have a pizza delivered to their house on a fitness app.

3. **Faster information.** In addition to speech-to-text being faster than typing, you're able to condense multiple tasks into one. For example, think about how you'd book a hotel room. Instead of using a form, you could start with "book me a hotel room at the Marriott in downtown Austin on February third."
