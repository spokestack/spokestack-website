Before [writing a script](/docs/Design/script-storyboard-responses), consider what you want users to ask and how you will respond. This is why it’s important to [know your audience](/docs/Design/get-to-know-your-audience). Focus on specific tasks that users can fulfill using voice. For example, buying a movie ticket. Actions the user wishes to perform are called **intents**. Buying a movie ticket could include intents to search for a movie title, to select a showtime, and one to confirm the purchase. The phrasing used to express an intent is called an **utterance**. For example, an utterance for the ‘SearchMovie’ intent could be ‘I want to see 1917’.

Visualize any problem(s) and or tasks/scenarios you’re trying to solve for. Write down a rough list of intents before mapping. Think of this as a fluid list that will help frame how you teach users what to ask. Keep adding intents to this list throughout as you see fit.

Imagine you’re working on a fitness tracker. For the purposes of this exercise, let’s call it MyRunBuddy. Here’s a list of some intents you might include:

# **What is it?**

When creating a multi-modal experience, don't design and build flows in isolation. This is where a mapping exercise can help.

An [experience map](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/channels-devices-touchpoints/) is a list of inputs from left to right with simultaneous outputs below. Multi-modal maps include intents and gestures followed by voice and visual outputs. A complete map will provide a better sense of scope before building anything.

Inspiration for this exercise comes from the [Sketch Phase](https://www.thesprintbook.com/how) of _The Design Sprint_ and [How to Make an Experience Map](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/08/03/experience-mapping-2/).

# **Getting Started**

Setup will depend on whether you’ll be working with a **colocated team**, a **remote team**, or as an **individual**.

## **Colocated teams**

You need sticky notes (4-6 different colors), markers, and an empty wall. Tape is optional, but recommended for sticky notes that become less sticky.

Invite everyone to your meeting space. Include a variety of teammates with differing areas of expertise. Choose someone to lead and record the discussion using sticky notes.

## **Remote teams**

You need a shared document that everyone can access and a video conferencing tool. For shared documentation, we use [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/). For video conferencing, we use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).

Schedule a video conference among colleagues with differing areas of expertise. Choose someone to guide and document the discussion. They need to screen share documentation as you go along. They may want to also record the video conference for future reference.

## **Individuals**

You need a shared document in case you need to gather feedback and share your map later on. We use [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

# **The exercise**

## [**For existing apps**](/docs/Design/for-existing-apps)

This will provide a convenience for users by incorporating a call-and-response experience. This exercise might also help those wanting to build upon one of our pre-existing demos.

## [**Starting from scratch**](/docs/Design/starting-from-scratch)

This exercise is for those who have a basic idea in mind, but are unsure of where to start design-wise.

## **A custom solution**

We provide on-site and remote experience mapping workshops tailored to your organization.
