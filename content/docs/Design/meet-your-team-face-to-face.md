This exercise is for teams with an existing app. Your goal should be to establish expectations. What are your KPIs? How would you measure success? You'll also uncover things that need further research.

Schedule time to talk with individuals on your team, even if you work with them daily. Have a list of questions prepared, but feel free to improvise. You want this to be comfortable, yet informative.

## Gather assumptions

Have them share their perspective on the app as-is. Here are a few questions to get you started:

1. What do you see as users' biggest pain points?
2. What's worked well in the past and what hasn't?
3. Do you foresee any constraints?

Notice the language they use when talking about features in the app. What words are they using? You can compare this with how users describe the same features later on.

## Gauge familiarity with multi-modal

Dig a little bit deeper. Understand their relationship to voice-only as well as multi-modal experiences. You might ask:

1. Is voice technology already an integral part of your daily life? If not, why?
2. How do you use voice technology, if at all? When? Where?

Write down patterns that emerge from your inquiries.
