A multi-modal interface is not a perfect fit for every problem. Keep in mind the following while conducting initial research:

1. What problem are you trying to solve for your business and your users?
2. How can a multi-modal solution solve or ease this problem?
3. Will it provide a more efficient way of accomplishing certain tasks?

Below, we've outlined a few techniques to get you started. These are not prescriptions. Complete some or all activities, especially if you're unsure where to begin.

## [Meet your team face-to-face](/docs/Design/meet-your-team-face-to-face)

Understand project goals (both qualitative and quantitative) or what needs further clarification.

## [Get to know your audience](/docs/Design/get-to-know-your-audience)

Determine if and how an investment in multi-modal can benefit your users.

## [Map out your integration](/docs/Design/map-out-integration)

For existing apps, start by mapping your app's experience as-is. This can help surface tasks that call & response can simplify.
