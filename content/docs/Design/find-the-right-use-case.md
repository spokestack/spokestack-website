In [Getting Started](/docs/Design/getting-started) we illustrated some of the advantages of a multi-modal interface in a smartphone app. Some of these advantages are more relevant to certain types of apps. Before starting to experience map your voice interface, the next step in the design process is to narrow down the use cases.

Here are some of the key questions to keep in mind when planning to add voice to a mobile app.

1. What are the problems or pain points you are trying to address with voice?
2. How can a multi-modal solution solve or ease this problem?
3. Will integrating voice provide a more effective way of accomplishing certain tasks?

Addressing all the different approaches to answering to these questions is well beyond the scope of this guide. But many boil down to two primary sources of information: your product team and your users.

## Tactics for Identifying Voice Integration Points

### Evaluate Product Objectives

A good place to start is by looking at measurable product objectives that have been hard to meet with graphical user interface changes. For example, you may be looking to increase the accuracy of search results. Perhaps spoken natural language search would be easier for some users? Or you may notice users are having trouble finding a certain setting. Maybe allowing a user to ask for it by voice would help?

### Consider App Context

Context is extremely import with multi-modal interactions. What are people doing while using your app? Some examples might include commuting (driving, biking, walking, etc.), exercising, cooking, and childcare. In many cases like the above your users may not have their hands free to perform touch interactions. This means both voice input and voice output could be valuable.

Where are people while using your app? Are they in a location where others may overhear interactions? If so, voice input but visual output could be appropriate. Finally, what devices are your users pairing with their mobile device? Some examples include Airpods, smart watches, and other voice-activated wearables.
