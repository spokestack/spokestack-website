Remember the survey and one-sheets you created while [getting to know your audience](/docs/Design/get-to-know-your-audience)? Refer to your findings from both when figuring out what and who to test your app with. What's your target audience's comfort level with multi-modal interfaces and/or voice?

Create prototypes using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/details.html) and/or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) to review design decisions with your team. Test a beta version of your app rather than a prototype in different contexts where possible. You want people to test your app on their phones, not in a browser. Include public test environments and candidates with varying accents where possible.

Conduct these tests unmoderated or moderated, remote or co-located.

## Unmoderated, remote

We recommend this if you're limited by time, man-power, and/or budget. Unmoderated candidates tend to give more honest feedback. Yet, you're unable to help users when they're stuck and ask follow-up questions. We use "task completion" tests for iOS, Android, or both on [UserBob](https://userbob.com/).

Prior to testing, create a [one-sheet](/docs/Design/get-to-know-your-audience) for each participant. Include relevant information provided by the testing platform under demographics.

1. **Write research questions.** These should include uncertainties you want to put to rest. Don't expose these to users. Think of these as internal measurement tools. Here are some examples:

- Do users understand the concept?
- Do they know what to ask or say? Are they asking the right questions? If not, what are they asking?
- Are they running into any errors?
- Where applicable, do they understand that your app is wakeword-enabled? Did they use this feature? If not, why?

2. **Provide a url for testing.** This could include a link to the app or google play store. Invite candidates to test the beta version of your app before testing. Provide instructions not to download before the test.

3. **Write a list of tasks based on your research questions, no more than 15.** Include follow-up questions to tasks you want further clarity on. A good follow-up question to ask before a user completes a task is: What would you expect to happen here? Try to avoid questions that project future behavior as it's hard to get honest feedback.

4. **Include a description of what the user should do.** Think of this as your intro. Add this before your list of tasks. Here's an example:

_"We're asking you to test a mobile app that lets you record different types of fitness activities. This is a work in progress, so if something doesn't work, explain what you would expect to happen and move on. We're testing the app, not you - no need to worry about making mistakes._

_Below are a series of tasks. Try completing each task using the app on your phone. As much as possible, think out loud as you go along: say what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking."_

5. **Iterate on your tasks and description if users get hung up on phrasing or if there's a bug.** Remember, you're collecting qualitative data, not quantitative. If you start to see users saying the same things, finish up that round of testing. Move on to tweaking your product before the next round of testing.

## Moderated, remote & co-located

This will feel very similar to the user interviews you conducted while [getting to know your audience](/docs/Design/get-to-know-your-audience). You can ask follow-up questions and improvise, but feedback can be less honest. Do this if you have more time and can meet users face-to-face.

Use your survey to recruit candidates. Allow yourself at least a week to schedule time to meet one-on-one with candidates. Email them a link where they can schedule a time to meet. We use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) and/or [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) to schedule meetings and share test times with the team. Provide instructions on how to sign-up for a time slot and set expectations for your meeting. Offer them an incentive if able.

If co-located, make sure candidates are local. Decide where you'll meet them. Will the environment be public? Or, more private? Will there be background noise? Keep in mind the context of what you are testing when making these decisions. Encourage users to bring and use their own device for testing. Bring a few extra mobile devices for testing in case users are unable to download your app.

Closer to your scheduled meeting, invite them to the beta version of your app. Provide instructions not to download before the test in your reminder email. Include a link to your video conference if remote and instruct on how they can join. If they don't follow this instruction, it's fine as long as they haven't interacted with your app. You want a fresh perspective.

Follow the same steps you would for unmoderated remote testing, but come prepared with a test script. Include instructions, tasks, and questions you may have. Here's a [sample](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1291FI3KTP8ycVwqcaTJITAe5jQHfnt_t5XaLnMBbD6E/edit) to get you started adopted from Steve Krug's [Rocket Surgery Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292).

Prior to testing, create a [one-sheet](/docs/Design/get-to-know-your-audience) for each participant. Include relevant information from the survey or your email correspondence under demographics. Write down questions specific to a candidate on their one-sheet and make not in your script of when to ask them.

Have your one-sheet on hand during the interview for infrequent note taking. If candidates feel comfortable, stream the discussion so your team can ask questions. For live streaming, we use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). For internal communication during interviews, we use [Slack](https://slack.com/).

After the interview, use your recording to document takeaways. Discuss insights with fellow observers. Allow no more than 20 minutes for this.

Every project presents a new set of challenges. Need someone to facilitate this process? We can help.
