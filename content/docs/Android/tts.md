**Note**: As of version 9.0.0, TTS is included in the turnkey `Spokestack` object. This guide is still valid as an in-depth introduction to the TTS module itself, but see [the configuration guide](turnkey-configuration) for more information about how it's integrated in newer versions of Spokestack.

Text-to-speech is a broad topic, but as far as Spokestack is concerned, there are two things your app has to handle: sending text or SSML to be synthesized, and playing the resulting audio for your users. This guide will cover both.

## Generating the audio

The best way to synthesize speech in Spokestack is to use the `TTSManager` subsystem. This small collection of components is built similarly to the `SpeechPipeline`, but it operates completely independently.

Here's how to initialize a `TTSManager` using Spokestack's TTS synthesis API:

```kotlin
private var tts: TTSManager? = null

// ...

tts = TTSManager.Builder()
  .setTTSServiceClass("io.spokestack.spokestack.tts.SpokestackTTSService")
  .setProperty("spokestack-id", "your-client-id")
  .setProperty("spokestack-secret", "your-secret-key")
  .addTTSListener(this)
  .build()
```

In this example, `spokestack-id` and `spokestack-secret` are set to sample values that let you try Spokestack TTS without creating an account. [Create an account](/account/create) or [sign in](/account/login) to get your own free API credentials.

Note also the `TTSListener` established here. This component will receive events from the TTS subsystem, including errors and audio URLs resulting from synthesis requests. If you're using Spokestack's built-in media player (described in the next section), you won't need to handle the URLs yourself, but you might still wish to log errors.

Once set up, synthesizing audio requires a single call to the TTS manager:

```kotlin
fun speak(text: String, mode: SynthesisRequest.Mode) {
  val synthRequest = SynthesisRequest.Builder(text).withMode(mode).build()
  tts?.synthesize(synthRequest)
}
```

The `mode` parameter is included here as a reminder that Spokestack supports a subset of the [SSML](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11) spec for specifying pronunciation and specific pause times. See [the TTS concept guide](/docs/Concepts/tts) for more information on providing SSML input. If you don't need this level of control, simply omit `mode`; the default mode of `SynthesisRequest`is plain text.

## Playing it

Spokestack lets you choose how you manage the audio for your app's voice, and the right option for you will likely depend on your app's category and feature set. There are two main categories of interest here:

### 1. I'm building a media app.

If your app makes heavy use of media already, you likely have a preferred media player, and you've developed (or will soon develop) a strategy for integrating it into the Android lifecycle. You probably want the maximum level of control over the audio Spokestack produces, and that's fine. All you have to do is establish a `TTSManager` and subscribe whatever class you want to receive audio URLs by adding `.addTTSEventListener()` to your builder call chain. You could even use the `SpokestackTTSClient` directly instead of the manager and register the URL handler as its callback. Whichever path you choose, the listener will receive any audio URLs produced by Spokestack's TTS service, and you can use them as you wishâ€”just make sure to play or download the audio within 60 seconds of receiving the URL, or it will become inaccessible.

### 2. What's a `MediaPlayer`?

If, on the other hand, your voice interaction will be the _only_ audio your app uses, you likely don't want the hassle of managing a media player. If that's the case, Spokestack can handle playback internally so you don't have to become an Android audio expert.

Note that this method provides your app with a headless media player; there are no UI elements to manage, but that also means that the user won't have a way to pause your app's voice. We'll consider adding a managed UI option based on demand, so if this is something you need, [join the discussion](https://github.com/spokestack/spokestack-android) on GitHub.

#### Prerequisites

Spokestack uses [ExoPlayer](https://exoplayer.dev/) for audio playback, which requires that your app to target API level 16 or above.

You'll also need to add the following dependencies to your app's `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  // ...

  implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.1.0'
  implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-core:2.11.0'
}
```

#### Usage

To use the built-in audio player to manage TTS responses, add the following to your `TTSManager` builder:

```kotlin
tts = TTSManager.Builder()
  // ...
  .setOutputClass("io.spokestack.spokestack.tts.SpokestackTTSOutput")
  .setAndroidContext(applicationContext)
  .build()
```

## Handing back the mic

For multi-turn conversations or system prompts that ask the user to respond, you'll want to reactivate ASR when the TTS audio is done playing. If you're using Spokestack's automatic playback, the best way to do this is by calling `activate()` on your [speech pipeline](speech-pipeline) instance when your TTS listener receives the `PLAYBACK_COMPLETE` event.
