This is a collection of code snippets and brief descriptions designed to help you be as productive as possible as quickly as possible. Check out the Concepts section on the left for more detailed discussions about the techniques mentioned here.

### Set up a default `SpeechPipeline`

```swift
import Spokestack

...

// The default configuration uses Apple's ASR as both a
// wakeword recognizer and speech recognizer
// `self` adopts the `SpeechEventListener` and
// `PipelineDelegate` protocols
let pipeline = SpeechPipeline(self, pipelineDelegate: self)

...

func startListening() {
    // Spokestack will start listening for its wakeword
    pipeline.start()
}
```

### Tap to talk

```swift
// `pipeline` is a `SpeechPipeline` instance as before
func onTalkButtonPressed() {
    // if the pipeline has been started elsewhere, you
    // don't need this line
    pipeline.start()

    // skips the wakeword activation and sends the pipeline
    // straight to ASR
    pipeline.activate()
}
```

### Use a custom wakeword

This example uses the default configuration, which is to say that Apple ASR is used as a wakeword detector. This may or may not perform well for your specific wakeword, but it should be suitable for demo purposes. Contact us for more information about developing a custom wakeword for your app.

```swift
import Spokestack

...

let pipeline: SpeechPipeline?

func initPipeline() {
    var config = SpeechConfiguration()
    config.wakewords = "custom,phrase"
    config.wakePhrases = "custom phrase"

    // `self` adopts the `SpeechEventListener` and
    // `PipelineDelegate` protocols
    self.pipeline = SpeechPipeline(
        SpeechProcessors.appleSpeech.processor,
        speechConfiguration: config,
        speechDelegate: self,
        wakewordService: SpeechProcessors.tfLiteWakeword,
        pipelineDelegate: self
    )
}
```

### Recognize Wakewords with [TFLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)

```swift
import Spokestack

...

// `self` adopts the `SpeechEventListener` and
// `PipelineDelegate` protocols
let pipeline = SpeechPipeline(
    SpeechProcessors.appleSpeech.processor,
    speechConfiguration: SpeechConfiguration(),
    speechDelegate: self,
    wakewordService: SpeechProcessors.tfLiteWakeword,
    pipelineDelegate: self
)
```

### Cancel ASR (before the timeout is reached)

```swift
// `pipeline` is a `SpeechPipeline` instance
func cancelAsr() {
    pipeline.deactivate()
}
```

When `deactivate` is called, Spokestack will continue listening for the next wakeword activation. To stop listening entirely, call

```swift
pipeline.stop()
```

After calling this, you'll need to call

```swift
pipeline.start()
```

before you'll be able to recognize a wakeword again.

If speech is being processed when `deactivate` is called, it will still be delivered to your `SpeechEventListener`'s `didRecognize` method when processing is complete.

### Play back synthesis result using your own `AVPlayer`

```swift
 class MyViewController: UIViewController, SpeechEventListener, TextToSpeechDelegate {

    // with your properties
    let player = AVPlayer()

    ...

    func success(url: URL) {
        let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: url)
        player.replaceCurrentItem(with: playerItem)
        player.play()
     }

    // implement the other functions of the TextToSpeechDelegate protocol...
```

Note that you'll need a strong reference to the `AVPlayer`; you can't just create it inside your `success` implementation.

At runtime, you'll send your text to Spokestack:

```swift
// with your properties
// assumes `self` adopts `TextToSpeechDelegate`
// uses default SpeechConfiguration values for api access.
let tts = TextToSpeech(self, configuration: SpeechConfiguration())

...

func speak(_ text: String) {
    let input = TextToSpeechInput(text)
    tts.synthesize(input)
}
```
