## Choose your integration:

As a tools and service provider, we try to balance ease of integration with customization for your voice interface needs.
1. **Custom Integration**: A custom integration gives the app developer full control of voice integration. For examples, check out the Spokestack Studio app on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spokestack-studio/id1508393980). Android currently not available. We recommend only _advanced_ mobile developers pursue this path.
2. **Spokestack Tray**. Spokestack Tray is a library that provides a voice interface overlay on your mobile app. Spokestack Tray can still be customized to meet branding requirements, but follows a specific use pattern. See our demo "Bartender" app on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/get-the-bartender/id1530425843) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spokestack.bartender) for examples of how Tray works with existing apps. In this case, a generic recipe app. This is the path we recommend for _intermediate_ to _advanced_ mobile developers. Want to see how you might customize Spokestack Tray for your app? We have a [Figma template] that can help you visualize Tray in your app.

Are you brand new to voice? Check out our [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbJ8fZh-iQw) as well as the [_Concepts_]sections of our docs. We also have a [voice design guide](/docs/Design/getting-started) to help you get started.
