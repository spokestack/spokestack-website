A smooth voice experience requires several different pieces of technology working together. The three primary systems involved are the [speech pipeline](/docs/concepts/speech-pipeline), responsible for listening to the user and converting their speech into text; [Natural Language Understanding](/docs/concepts/nlu), which translates phrases and sentences into actionable input for an application; and [Text to Speech](/docs/concepts/tts), which converts textual system responses into audio to be read to the user.

These pages exist to introduce, in a platform-indepedent way, how Spokestack uses these technologies and lets you configure them. They also cover general topics like [converting an NLU model](/docs/integrations/export) from other voice assistant platforms into Spokestack's format and even how to [design custom wake word models](/docs/concepts/wakeword-models) for use with Spokestack.

If you're looking for code samples, please see the section dedicated to your mobile platform of choice.
